ThumbnailBox
============

This is just a simple thumbnail widget.
Additional features will be added as necessary.

Example usage:
//...
ThumbnailBox thumbnailbox = new ThumbnailBox(this);
thumbnailbox->setNameFilter(QStringList() << "*.jpg" << "*.bmp");
thumbnailbox->navigateTo(path);
connect(txt_pathbox,
        SIGNAL(textEdited(const QString&)),
        thumbnailbox,
        SLOT(navigateTo(const QString&)));
//...

Notes:
* The wheel only works right above the scrollbar.
  This will probably be fixed some day (or maybe not).
* For non-picture file, a text-only thumbnail will be shown
  (in other words, no preview image).
* This thing really doesn't do much. It's just a box with thumbnails.
